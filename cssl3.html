			Color codes are ways of representing the colors we see everyday in a format that a computer can interpret and display. Commonly used in websites and other software applications, there are a variety of formats, including Hex color codes, RGB and HSL values, and HTML color names, amongst others.
	Hex color codes

	The most popular are Hex color codes; three byte hexadecimal numbers (meaning they consist of six digits), with each byte, or pair of characters in the Hex code, representing the intensity of red, green and blue in the color respectively.
	#XXXXXX

	Hex code byte values range from 00, which is the lowest intensity of a color, to FF which represents the highest intensity. The color white, for example, is made by mixing each of the three primary colors at their full intensity, resulting in the Hex color code of #FFFFFF.
	#FFFFFF

	Black, the absence of any color on a screen display, is the complete opposite, with each color displayed at their lowest possible intensity and a Hex color code of #000000.
	#000000

			or background (also known as a desktop wallpaper, desktop background, desktop picture or desktop image on computers) is a digital image (photo, drawing etc.) used as a decorative background of a graphical user interface on the screen of a computer, smartphone or other electronic devices. On a computer, wallpapers are generally used on the desktop, while on a mobile phone they serve as the background for the home screen. Though most devices come with a default background image, modern devices usually allow users to manually change the background image:

			Understanding the basics of Hex color code notation we can create grayscale colors very easily, since they consist of equal intensities of each color:
	#454545
	#999999

	The three primary colors, red, green and blue, are made by mixing the highest intensity of the desired color with the lowest intensities of the other two:
	#FF0000
	#00FF00
	#0000FF

	With modern browsers supporting the full spectrum of 24-bit color, there are 16,777,216 different color possibilities.
